A little about me:

🔭 I’m currently working on developing a financial analysis tool inspired by Koyfin. This project is a fantastic opportunity for me to enhance my skills in programming and application development, while also exploring advanced financial data analysis and visualization techniques.

🌱 I’m currently learning React, Java, SQL and Python. These powerful tools and languages are broadening my programming skills and opening up new possibilities.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on innovative open-source projects, especially those leveraging my growing skills in Java, C, Python, and app development.

💬 Ask me about my various projects, my journey in learning Java, C# and Python, or anything tech-related!

# Hi there 👋

I'm Kabelo – welcome to my GitHub profile!

### A little about me:
🔍 **Passionate about low-level programming and cybersecurity.**  
I'm diving deep into system-level programming, reverse engineering, and exploit development. My current focus is on mastering C, assembly, and understanding how software works from the ground up.

💻 **Learning & Exploration:**  
I'm in the process of building a strong foundation in:
- **Languages & Tools:** C, assembly, Bash, and Python.
- **Concepts:** Operating system internals, system calls, memory management, and common security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and return-oriented programming.
- **Practice:** Engaging with challenges from OverTheWire, crackmes.one, and other reverse engineering exercises.

🌱 **Current Focus:**  
While I haven't built any full-fledged projects yet, I'm actively learning and planning to create educational demos—like vulnerable programs and simple exploit examples—to document my journey and share insights with the community.

🤝 **Collaboration & Community:**  
I'm eager to connect with others in cybersecurity and low-level programming. Whether you're willing to share advice, resources, or just chat about reverse engineering and security, feel free to reach out!

📫 **Reach Me:**  
Drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kabelo-dike) or open an issue if you'd like to connect.

😄 **Pronouns:** He/Him

⚡ **Fun fact:**  
When I'm not immersed in code or security challenges, I enjoy playing soccer gaming, stock trading, and exploring the latest tech trends.

Thanks for stopping by—let's keep learning and stay curious!

# Hi there 👋  

I'm Kabelo – welcome to my GitHub profile!  

### About Me  
🔍 **Low-level programming & cybersecurity enthusiast**  
I’m focused on system-level development, reverse engineering, and security. My work revolves around understanding computers from the ground up—how they execute code, manage memory, and expose vulnerabilities.  

### 💻 What I’m Building & Learning  
- **Projects:**  
  - ✅ Custom Linux shell (finished)  
  - 🔧 TCP chat app in C (in progress)  
  - 📚 Upcoming: SQLite clone, toy operating system, modular browser  
- **Languages & Tools:** C, Assembly, Bash, Python  
- **Concepts:** Operating system internals, syscalls, memory management, exploitation (buffer overflows, ROP)  

### 🌱 Current Focus  
Building a strong foundation in low-level programming while documenting my journey through demos, writeups, and exploratory projects. My end goal is to develop useful systems tools, contribute to open-source, and push deeper into cybersecurity.  

### 🤝 Collaboration & Community  
I love connecting with others interested in systems, security, and computer internals. If you’re into reverse engineering, exploit dev, or just geeking out about low-level code, let’s talk!
